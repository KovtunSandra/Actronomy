				<center><h1>Why is astronomy important?</h1></center>
				<p>One of the most important reasons why astronomy is important is that it helps us understand our place in the universe. By studying the stars and other celestial bodies, we can learn about the origins of the universe, how galaxies form, and the conditions necessary for life to exist. Astronomy also helps us understand the nature of time and space, and how they are interconnected.

				<p>Another reason why astronomy is important is that it has practical applications in our everyday lives. For example, GPS navigation relies on precise measurements of the position of satellites in space, which are made possible by the principles of astronomy. Astronomy also helps us understand the effects of space weather on Earth, which can impact our communication and power systems. By studying the universe, we can gain insights that can help us solve problems here on Earth.
